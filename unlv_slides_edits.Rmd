scholars have noted that in hunter-gather populations, the number of people involved in fighting ~40% of the population, but this drops in state-level societies. 

"re people in big, modern societies more or less violent than our forebears? The answer is neither, according to a controversial new study: People who lived in small bands in the past had no more proclivity toward violence than we do today. The finding—based on estimates of war casualties throughout history—undercuts the popular argument that humans have become a more peaceful species over time, thanks to advances in technology and governance. But some critics aren’t convinced.

That includes the man who most recently popularized the idea, psychologist Steven Pinker of Harvard University, who calls the new findings “a statistical gimmick.” He argues in his 2011 book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined that the emergence of institutions like nation-states with strong central governments, trade networks, and wide-ranging communication increased interdependence and reduced deaths due to violence. He cited data suggesting that fewer people die in wars today, relative to a society’s total population, than among small tribes of hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and horticulturalists—how human society organized for most of its history.

But a team led by anthropologist Rahul Oka at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana wondered whether there was a mathematical explanation for why fewer people proportionally are lost to violence nowadays. They reasoned that as populations get bigger, their armies don’t necessarily grow at the same rate. In a small group of 100 adults, for example, it would be perfectly reasonable to have 25 warriors, says anthropologist and study co-author Mark Golitko, also at Notre Dame. But in a population of 100 million, supporting and coordinating an army of 25 million soldiers is logistically impossible, to say nothing of such an army’s effectiveness. Researchers call that incongruity a scaling effect."

To test this collected data on population & war group size for ~300 socieites and data from speicfic historical conflicts



is this drop in the number of people involved in war (what we call the “war group”) due to the effects of living in a state or is it a reflection of broader issues that appear when population increases?
We collected data on population and war group size from 295 societies and on war group size and conflict-related casualties from 430 historical conflicts going back to 2500 B.C. We show that, as population goes up, the proportion of people involved in conflict decreases.  In other words, it is not that states prevent violence, but rather that other factors, such as the need to feed, cloth, and arm a war group makes it harder to involve a large percentage of people in more complex societies.

Demographic conflict investment: relative measure of number of individuals involved in conflict accounting for scale in group population

The exponent X serves as a measure of how many individuals
are being committed to the unit’s war group, hereafter
known as demographic conflict investment (DCI) in relation to P.

DCI is remarkably sensitive at identifying changing conflict
needs and shows fluctuations even for small engagements,
especially in earlier periods, where personnel are the primary
investment rather than technology.
ii) Trends in DCI show some decreasing demographic investment
in conflict over time, suggesting that most modern
nations have reached optimal sizes of armies that they can
and desire to sustain at any time subject to population conflict
needs, other economic or cultural considerations, or
investments in conflict technology rather than personnel,
all of which may contribute to declining DCI.
iii) Increases in DCI at the time of major conflict are significant
indicators of conflict investment, regardless of technology, as
states tend to increase numbers of combatants in the field
during active combat. This is especially pertinent given the
lessons from the Iraq War (2003–2011), Afghanistan (2001 to
present), and Syria (2011 to present) that clearly show that
technology may not easily replace “boots-on-the-ground.”
